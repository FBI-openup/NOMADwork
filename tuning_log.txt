Run log for beta.in scoring

V5 (42.685)
- Baseline with MILP + greedy warm start + piecewise 1/k, flow-weighted objective.

V6 (42.685)
- Greedy tuning: INERTIA_BONUS 2.0 -> 4.0, ETA_BONUS_HB 1.5 -> 1.0.
- No score change.

V7 (42.685)
- Greedy tuning: add short-horizon capacity lookahead bonus (window=3, scale=0.5).
- No score change.

V8 (42.685)
- Postprocess: consolidate to dominant landing cell within capacity.
- No score change.

V9 (42.685)
- Postprocess: left-shift segments earlier within capacity to improve delay.
- No score change.

V10 (42.685)
- Candidate generation: CAPACITY_BUFFER 1.5 -> 1.05, MAX_SLOTS_PER_CELL 150 -> 80.
- No score change.

V11 (40.037)
- Greedy candidate cap reduced: GREEDY_TOP_K 99 -> 20.
- Fixed postprocess to respect earliest arrival at anchor. Score dropped; reverted later.

V12 (42.685)

V13 (42.685)
- Increased MILP timeLimit to 20s, tightened gap to 0.0.
- No score change vs baseline.

V14 (42.685)
- Candidate cell ranking: switched to composite of early availability, near-term capacity, and distance.
- No score change.

V15 (78.067 on hotspot_small)
- Added cluster acceptance guard with local scorer to keep MILP only if it improves total score vs greedy.
- Added exact local scoring in submission.py.
- No change vs baseline on hotspot_small.

V16 (78.067 on hotspot_small)
- Reduced ROLLING_WINDOW (50->30) to shrink per-cluster MILP size.
- No change; reverted later in V18.

V17 (78.067 on hotspot_small)
- Added switch penalty approximation across consecutive seconds to encourage fewer landing episodes.
- No change on hotspot_small.

V18 (78.067 on hotspot_small)
- Increased ROLLING_WINDOW to 80 and stronger switch penalty.
- No change.

V19 (74.253 on hotspot1)
- Evaluated current settings on hotspot1 (larger, biased).
- No change vs baseline on this instance.

V20 (81.810 on overlap1)
- Generated overlap1.in (dense early starts). Baseline score recorded.

V21 (81.810 on overlap1)
- Increased ROLLING_WINDOW to 120.
- No change.

V22 (81.810 on overlap1)
- Increased switch penalty weight.
- No change.

V23 (80.241 on wide_rects)
- Generated wide_rects.in (very wide landing rectangles).
- Baseline score recorded.

V24 (80.241 on wide_rects)
- Attempted to disable acceptance guard (always take MILP). No change.

V25 (80.241 on wide_rects)
- Expanded candidate pool: CAPACITY_BUFFER 2.0, MAX_SLOTS_PER_CELL 200.
- No change.

V26 (80.241 on wide_rects)
- Explicitly set ACCEPT_GUARD = False in code; no score change.

V27 (68.309 on narrow_rects)
- Generated narrow_rects.in (tight landing rectangles), baseline score.

V28 (68.309 on narrow_rects)
- Reduced GREEDY_TOP_K to 30. No change.

V29 (68.309 on narrow_rects)
- Increased MILP time limit to 30s. No change.

V30 (68.308 on narrow_rects)
- Increased LOOKAHEAD_WINDOW 3 -> 5. Slight rounding difference.

V31 (81.807 on overlap1)
- Re-enabled acceptance guard and set MILP timeLimit to 10s; GREEDY_TOP_K back to 99.
- Minor change vs baseline (rounding).

V32 (72.749 on phase_stripes)
- New instance with stripe-x phases, sparse B, pareto volumes, bimodal starts, wide rectangles.
- Score recorded; MILP acceptance guard enabled.

V33 (68.078 on phase_checker)
- Checker phases, sparse B, pareto volumes, bimodal starts, tall rectangles.
- Score recorded.

V34 (72.749 on phase_stripes)
